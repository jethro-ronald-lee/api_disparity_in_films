The research question I explored is whether the American film industry is progressing in increasing representation for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. To answer this question, I needed to know about the prevalence of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as movie characters across many films over a certain time frame.

As an Asian American, I am instilled with the hope that I can still achieve my dreams as a minority in America whenever I see an Asian American actor depicted on television or in a film. Unfortunately, most roles in American movies are still occupied by white actors. Increasing the acknowledgment of how racism affects the film industry can raise the likelihood of constructive change. As the media becomes increasingly ingrained into our lives, opportunities for people of color to see themselves represented in the media for the world to acknowledge are still scarce. While it’s joyful seeing Asian Americans celebrate small victories in the American film industry such as Simu Liu’s success, the triumph of Squid Game, or Youn Yuh-Jung’s momentous Oscar win, their need to celebrate suggests that America has yet to approach the normalization of integrating people of color in its films.
